## Translation :id=translation
### Translation of document comments :id=docs-translation

You can now translate document comments in your code with one click. You no longer have to manually select text before translating, and you don't have to worry about interference with elements in the document comments, such as document marker symbols, HTML elements, etc.

?> _Note:_ When using this feature, it is recommended to use Google Translate and upgrade the IDE to the latest version for best translation results.

## Settings :id=settings
### Font preview :id=font-preview

We've optimized font previews on the **Translation Settings** page to show real text rendering. Previously, due to the main IDE font, the preview text did not render correctly with the selected font, resulting in the preview being inconsistent with what was shown on the plugin UI.
