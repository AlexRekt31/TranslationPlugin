### Quick Documentation translation :id=quick-doc-translation

_Thanks to [Nikolay Tropin](https://github.com/niktrop)(from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/)) for the implementation of this feature!_

We've added support for the translation of **Quick Documentation**. You can now translate documentation in your code anytime, anywhere, without being limited to documentation comments in the source code.For example, on Windows, when you view **Quick Documentation** using the shortcut <kbd>**Ctrl + Q**</kbd>, you'll see the translated documentation immediately.

The translation option for Quick Documentation is turned on by default. If you would like to disable this function, please head to the plugin configuration page.
