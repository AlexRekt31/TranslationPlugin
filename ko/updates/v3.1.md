### User experience modifications :id=ux-adjustments

We always try to find a balance between the discoverability of a feature and the simplicity of the UI, which usually means that when a feature is unlikely to be used, the relevant UI elements will not be displayed in the context menu.That's why we have made some adjustments in this regard.

- **Context menu**  
  The translation action always appears at the top of the context menu, so when we are looking for other actions, it can be distracting.  
  ![Context menu](/updates/img/v3_1/context_menu.png)  
  So we made some adjustments â€” the context menu now only displays the translation action only when a text is selected.(Automatic selection will still work if the action is called using a shortcut, so there is no need to select the text)

  Of course, if you're not used to these actions, you can modify them on the Settings page.

- **Translate engine widget**  
  The translation engine widget is displayed only when more than one translation engine is available.
- **Word Book tool window**  
  The Word Book tool window is hidden when the Word Book is not available or there are no words in the Word Book.
